# Data Science

I've been thinking about setting up a portfolio to show case a number of interesting projects I have been working on. The portfolio is also a geat opportunity to polish some of the work.

There are a number of intersting discussions within the blogospere on the importance of aving the right sort of protfolio of projects. In this case the effort is more on orgenising a showcase for many projects that are scattered all over the web. For me this is also a bit of an experiment - to see how effectivly one can rapidly create story boards for data science. 


## Up and running with *Jekyll*

Jekyll is perhaps the favourite platform in R and data science world.
Some adavatages are support for
 * htmlwidgets
 * Rmakdown + knitr
 * numerous plugins
 * github based hosting.
