---

I've been thinking about setting up a portfollio for a while. It certainly can save time when discussing projects that are scattered all over the web. Anyhow this is also a bit of an experiment.

Up and running with *Jekll* - perhaps a favourite in R and data science world.
collness includes 
 * htmlwidgets support
 * Rmakdown + knitr


p.s. 
 * https://brendanrocks.com/blogging-with-rmarkdown-knitr-jekyll/
 * https://brendanrocks.com/htmlwidgets-knitr-jekyll/
 * http://www.htmlwidgets.org/
 * d3.js

very quick setup and this project is all about agility and rapid integration!



cheers!
